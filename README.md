## AWS Kubernetes Automation with Helm, Kops, and Ansible
This repository deploys an app on AWS together with automating the setup of a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Helm for package management, Kops for cluster provisioning, and Ansible for configuration management. By combining these tools, you can streamline the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters on AWS.

## Overview
Deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters on AWS involves multiple steps, from provisioning the infrastructure to configuring the cluster components. This repository provides a structured approach to automating these processes, resulting in consistent, repeatable, and manageable Kubernetes deployments.

## Features
# Helm:
Helm simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications by providing package management capabilities and pre-defined charts. It enables you to define, install, and upgrade complex applications on your Kubernetes clusters.

# Kops:
Kops is a tool for automating the provisioning and management of Kubernetes clusters on AWS. It handles the creation and configuration of cluster resources, making it easier to manage production-ready clusters.

# Ansible:
Ansible is used for configuration management, enabling you to define the desired state of your cluster components and manage configuration changes over time.
